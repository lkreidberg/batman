Installation
============
pip
---
You can install ``batman`` with pip (recommended):

::

	$ pip install batman-package

From source
-----------
You can also install directly from source. The most current `stable release <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/batman-package/>`_ is up on PyPI and the `development version <https://github.com/lkreidberg/batman>`_ can be found on GitHub.


Unpack the distribution with ``tar -xvf`` and navigate to the source root directory.  To install, run the setup script:

::

   $ sudo python setup.py install

Note that you'll need to ``cd`` out of the source directory **before** you can import ``batman``.
